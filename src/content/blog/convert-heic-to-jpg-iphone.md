# How to Convert HEIC to JPG From iPhone

You just transferred photos from your iPhone to your computer, and none of them will open. Or you tried attaching one to an email and the recipient says they cannot view it. The culprit? A file format called HEIC that your iPhone has been using without telling you.

This guide explains what HEIC is, why Apple chose it, and how to quickly convert your photos to the universally supported JPG format.

## What Is HEIC and Why Does Your iPhone Use It?

HEIC stands for High Efficiency Image Container. It is based on the HEIF (High Efficiency Image Format) standard, which uses the same compression technology as modern video codecs. Apple adopted HEIC as the default photo format starting with iOS 11 in 2017.

The main reason is simple: **HEIC files are about half the size of equivalent JPGs** while maintaining the same visual quality. For a phone that stores thousands of photos, this adds up. A 64 GB iPhone can hold roughly twice as many HEIC photos compared to JPG.

HEIC also supports features that JPG cannot:

- **16-bit color depth** (vs. 8-bit for JPG), which means smoother gradients and better color accuracy.
- **Transparency support**, similar to PNG files.
- **Multiple images in one file**, which is how Live Photos and burst shots are stored.
- **Non-destructive editing**, allowing iOS to store edits without modifying the original image data.

## The Compatibility Problem

Despite its technical advantages, HEIC is not universally supported. Here are common situations where you will run into issues:

- **Windows**: Native HEIC support was added in Windows 10 (version 1809), but it requires installing a free codec from the Microsoft Store. Many Windows users do not have it.
- **Older software**: Photo editors, document tools, and web applications that have not been updated may not recognize HEIC files.
- **Web uploads**: Most websites and web forms expect JPG or PNG. Trying to upload a HEIC file often fails silently or shows an error.
- **Email and messaging**: Some email clients and messaging apps cannot display HEIC attachments inline.
- **Printing services**: Online print shops almost universally require JPG or PNG uploads.

If you are sharing photos with anyone who does not use Apple devices, JPG is the safest choice.

## How to Convert HEIC to JPG With PrivaTools

PrivaTools converts HEIC files to JPG entirely in your browser. Your photos are never uploaded to any server, which is especially important for personal photos you would rather keep private.

Here is how to do it:

1. **Transfer your photos to your computer.** Use AirDrop, iCloud, a USB cable, or email. Any method works as long as the HEIC files end up on your device.
2. **Open the [JPG Converter](/convert-to-jpg)** on PrivaTools.
3. **Drag and drop your HEIC files** into the converter, or click to browse and select them. You can convert multiple files at once.
4. **Adjust quality if needed.** The default quality setting produces excellent results for most use cases. Lower the quality slightly if you need smaller files.
5. **Download your JPGs.** Each converted file is ready to share, upload, or print.

The conversion happens instantly for most photos. Since everything runs locally, the speed depends on your device rather than your internet connection.

## Getting Photos Off Your iPhone

If you are not sure how to transfer photos from your iPhone to your computer, here are the most common methods:

### AirDrop (Mac only)
The fastest option if you have a Mac. Select photos in the Photos app, tap the share button, and choose your Mac. The files arrive in your Downloads folder. Note that AirDrop sends the original HEIC files by default.

### iCloud Photos
If you have iCloud Photos enabled, your images sync automatically. On a Mac, open the Photos app. On Windows, install iCloud for Windows. Downloaded originals will be in HEIC format.

### USB Cable
Connect your iPhone to your computer with a Lightning or USB-C cable. On Mac, use Image Capture or Photos. On Windows, use the Photos app or File Explorer. You may be prompted to choose between "Keep Originals" (HEIC) or "Most Compatible" (JPG). If you select "Most Compatible," iOS converts to JPG during transfer, but at the cost of slightly larger files and some quality loss from double compression.

### Email or Messaging
When you email a photo to yourself, iOS typically converts it to JPG automatically. However, this adds compression artifacts and limits resolution. It is better to transfer the original HEIC and convert it yourself for maximum quality.

## Preventing HEIC in the Future (Optional)

If you want your iPhone to shoot in JPG from now on, you can change the setting:

1. Open **Settings** > **Camera** > **Formats**.
2. Select **Most Compatible** instead of High Efficiency.

Keep in mind that this will roughly double the storage space your photos use. For most people, shooting in HEIC and converting when needed is the better approach.

## A Note on Privacy

Personal photos are, by definition, personal. Many online converters require you to upload your images to their servers for processing. Even if they claim to delete files after conversion, you are trusting a third party with your private moments.

With PrivaTools, the conversion runs entirely in your browser using client-side JavaScript. Your photos stay on your device from start to finish. No account required, no uploads, no tracking.

Head over to the [JPG Converter](/convert-to-jpg) to convert your HEIC photos right now.
