# PrivaTools vs Smallpdf: Free PDF Tools Compared

Smallpdf markets itself as "the PDF software that millions love." It is a well-designed platform with a wide range of PDF tools. But there is a catch that many users discover quickly: the free plan is heavily limited, and using most features requires an account and a paid subscription.

PrivaTools takes a different approach. Every tool is free, unlimited, and works without uploading your files. Let's compare the two services in detail.

## The Free Plan Reality

When you search for "free PDF tools," Smallpdf shows up prominently. But the experience of using Smallpdf for free can be frustrating.

**Smallpdf free plan limitations:**
- 2 tasks per day (across all tools)
- Account required for most operations
- Files uploaded to Smallpdf's cloud servers
- Limited file size (up to 5 GB on Pro)
- Ads on the free tier

After your second task of the day, Smallpdf presents a paywall. If you need to compress a PDF, then merge two documents, then split another file, you have already exceeded your daily limit before finishing your third task.

**PrivaTools:**
- Unlimited tasks, every day
- No account needed
- No file uploads
- No ads
- Completely free

There is no bait-and-switch. You can [compress PDFs](/compress-pdf), [merge documents](/merge-pdf), and [split files](/split-pdf) as many times as you need without ever seeing a paywall or a login form.

## Privacy and File Handling

Smallpdf processes files on their cloud servers. When you upload a PDF, it travels across the internet to Smallpdf's infrastructure, gets processed there, and then you download the result. Smallpdf states that files are deleted from their servers after one hour, and they offer end-to-end encryption on their Pro plan.

That said, the fundamental issue remains: your file leaves your device and is processed by a third party.

PrivaTools processes every file directly in your browser. The PDF never leaves your computer. This is not just a privacy policy. It is a technical architecture choice. There is no server to upload to, no cloud storage, and no encryption needed because your data never enters a network.

| Privacy Aspect | PrivaTools | Smallpdf |
|---|---|---|
| File upload | None | Required |
| Server processing | None | Cloud-based |
| File retention | None (local only) | 1 hour (free) |
| End-to-end encryption | Not needed | Pro only |
| Account required | Never | Yes (most features) |
| Offline capable | Yes | No |

For legal documents, tax returns, medical records, employment contracts, and other sensitive files, the privacy gap between these two tools is significant.

## Feature Comparison

Smallpdf has built an extensive feature set over the years. Here is how the two platforms compare:

| Feature | PrivaTools | Smallpdf |
|---|---|---|
| Compress PDF | Yes (unlimited) | Yes (2/day free) |
| Merge PDF | Yes (unlimited) | Yes (2/day free) |
| Split PDF | Yes (unlimited) | Yes (2/day free) |
| PDF to Word | Not yet | Yes |
| Word to PDF | Not yet | Yes |
| PDF to Excel | Not yet | Yes |
| E-sign | No | Yes |
| OCR | Not yet | Yes (Pro) |
| Edit PDF text | Not yet | Yes (Pro) |
| Image tools | Yes | Limited |

Smallpdf wins on breadth of features. If you need document conversion, e-signatures, or OCR, Smallpdf covers those use cases. But every one of those features is subject to the 2-task daily limit on the free plan, or requires a Pro subscription.

PrivaTools focuses on the most essential PDF and image operations. Every tool that exists on the platform is fully free and fully unlimited.

## Pricing Breakdown

**Smallpdf Pro:** $12/month (billed annually) or $21/month billed monthly. This unlocks unlimited tasks, batch processing, larger file sizes, and premium features like OCR and desktop app access.

**Smallpdf Team:** $10/user/month (billed annually) for team management features.

**PrivaTools:** Free. There is no paid tier. All features are available to everyone, always.

Over a year, a Smallpdf Pro subscription costs $144. For a team of five, that is $600/year. PrivaTools delivers its core feature set at zero cost.

## Speed and User Experience

Both tools have clean, modern interfaces. Smallpdf deserves credit for its polished design and intuitive workflows.

However, speed is a different story. Smallpdf requires an internet connection for every operation. Large files take time to upload, process, and download. On slower connections, a simple compress-and-download cycle for a 30 MB PDF can take several minutes.

PrivaTools processes files instantly on your device. Open the [compress PDF tool](/compress-pdf), drop your file, and the result is ready in seconds. No upload progress bar, no waiting for server processing, no download step. The compressed file is generated right in your browser.

## When to Use Each Tool

**Choose PrivaTools if:**
- You want truly free PDF tools with no daily limits
- File privacy is important to you
- You need to process multiple files in a single session
- You prefer not to create accounts for simple tasks

**Choose Smallpdf if:**
- You need advanced features like PDF-to-Word conversion or OCR
- You are willing to pay for a Pro subscription
- You need e-signature capabilities
- You want a desktop application

## Final Thoughts

Smallpdf is a well-built product, but its free tier is designed to funnel users toward a paid subscription. The 2-task daily limit makes it impractical for regular use without paying.

PrivaTools offers a genuinely free alternative for core PDF operations. No limits, no accounts, no uploads. If you need to [compress](/compress-pdf), [merge](/merge-pdf), or [split](/split-pdf) PDFs on a regular basis, PrivaTools delivers the same results without the restrictions or the privacy trade-offs.
