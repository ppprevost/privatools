# How to Compress a PDF for Email Attachments

You have a PDF ready to send, but your email client rejects it because the file is too large. This is one of the most common frustrations in everyday digital work. Whether you are sending a contract, a presentation, a report, or a portfolio, oversized PDFs can stop your workflow in its tracks.

The good news: compressing a PDF is fast and easy. You do not need to install software or upload your document to a third-party server. Here is everything you need to know about getting your PDF under the email size limit.

## Email Attachment Size Limits

Every major email provider enforces a maximum attachment size. Here are the current limits:

| Email Provider | Maximum Attachment Size |
|---|---|
| Gmail | 25 MB |
| Outlook / Microsoft 365 | 20 MB |
| Yahoo Mail | 25 MB |
| Apple iCloud Mail | 20 MB |
| ProtonMail | 25 MB |

These limits apply to the total size of all attachments combined, not per file. If you are attaching multiple documents, the combined size needs to stay under the limit.

It is also worth noting that email encoding (MIME/Base64) increases the effective file size by roughly 33%. A 20 MB file might actually require around 27 MB of bandwidth once encoded. Some email clients account for this internally, but others do not. To be safe, aim for attachments well under the stated limit.

## Why PDFs Get So Large

PDFs can balloon in size for several reasons:

- **Embedded images**: Photos and graphics stored at full resolution inside the PDF are the most common culprit. A single high-resolution image can add 5-10 MB.
- **Embedded fonts**: PDFs often embed the full font files used in the document, especially when custom or uncommon typefaces are involved.
- **Scanned documents**: PDFs created from scanned pages are essentially collections of high-resolution images, making them significantly larger than text-based PDFs.
- **Multiple pages**: Longer documents naturally take up more space, especially when each page contains images or complex layouts.
- **Redundant metadata**: Edit history, form data, annotations, and embedded thumbnails all add to file size.

Understanding why your PDF is large helps you set realistic expectations for compression. A text-heavy PDF with minimal images might compress from 15 MB to 3 MB. A PDF full of high-resolution scans might go from 50 MB to 15 MB. The compression ratio depends heavily on the content.

## How to Compress a PDF with PrivaTools

Follow these steps to reduce your PDF file size in seconds:

### Step 1: Open the Compress PDF Tool

Go to [PrivaTools Compress PDF](/compress-pdf). No account or signup is needed.

### Step 2: Add Your PDF

Drag and drop your PDF file onto the upload area, or click to browse your files. Your document loads instantly because it stays on your device. Nothing is uploaded to any server.

### Step 3: Choose Your Compression Level

PrivaTools offers multiple compression presets:

- **Low compression**: Minimal quality loss, smaller file size reduction. Best when you need to preserve image clarity, such as for portfolios or photo-heavy reports.
- **Medium compression**: A balanced option that reduces file size significantly while keeping the document looking sharp. This is the best choice for most email attachments.
- **High compression**: Maximum file size reduction with more noticeable quality loss on images. Ideal when you need to get under a tight size limit and image quality is secondary.

### Step 4: Download Your Compressed PDF

Once processing completes (usually within seconds), download the compressed file. Check the file size to confirm it fits within your email provider's limit.

## Tips for Maximum Compression

If your PDF is still too large after compression, try these additional strategies:

**Split the document.** If your PDF has many pages, consider using the [split PDF tool](/split-pdf) to break it into smaller sections. Send each part as a separate attachment or in separate emails.

**Remove unnecessary pages.** Does the recipient really need every page? Use the [split tool](/split-pdf) to extract only the relevant pages before compressing.

**Check for embedded media.** Some PDFs contain embedded videos or audio files. These dramatically increase file size and often are not needed for the recipient.

**Re-export from the source.** If you have access to the original document (Word, PowerPoint, InDesign), try exporting a new PDF with lower image quality settings. This often produces better results than compressing an already-generated PDF.

**Use "Print to PDF" as a pre-step.** Opening a bloated PDF and using your operating system's "Print to PDF" function can strip out metadata, annotations, and embedded elements, producing a cleaner file before you compress it.

## What About Cloud Links Instead?

If compression alone is not enough, consider sharing your PDF via a cloud storage link (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive) instead of as an attachment. This avoids the size limit entirely.

However, many professionals prefer direct attachments for important documents. Attachments do not expire, do not require the recipient to have a specific account, and ensure the file is available even if the sharing link breaks later. For contracts, invoices, and official documents, attachments remain the standard.

## A Note on Privacy

Most online PDF compression tools require you to upload your file to their servers. If your document contains sensitive information (financial data, personal details, legal content, medical records) this creates a privacy risk.

PrivaTools avoids this entirely. Your PDF is processed in your browser using client-side technology. The file never leaves your device. There are no servers involved, no temporary storage, and no data collection. You can even verify this by checking your browser's network activity while compressing a file.

## Summary

Compressing a PDF for email does not have to be complicated. With [PrivaTools Compress PDF](/compress-pdf), you can reduce file size in seconds, privately, for free, and without any limits. Choose the right compression level for your needs, and your PDF will be inbox-ready in no time.
