# Resize Images for Social Media (Instagram, LinkedIn, Twitter)

Posting an image with the wrong dimensions on social media can ruin your content. Your carefully designed graphic gets cropped awkwardly, text gets cut off, or the image appears blurry because the platform scaled it down. Each social network has its own preferred dimensions, and getting them right makes the difference between a polished post and a sloppy one.

This guide covers the recommended image sizes for the most popular platforms in 2026, along with step-by-step instructions for resizing your images using PrivaTools.

## Instagram Image Sizes

Instagram is the most dimension-sensitive platform. Different content types require different aspect ratios.

### Feed Posts

| Format | Dimensions | Aspect Ratio |
|---|---|---|
| Square | 1080 x 1080 px | 1:1 |
| Portrait | 1080 x 1350 px | 4:5 |
| Landscape | 1080 x 566 px | 1.91:1 |

**Best practice:** Portrait (1080 x 1350) takes up the most screen space in the feed and tends to get higher engagement. Square (1080 x 1080) is the classic format and works well for product photos and graphics.

### Stories and Reels

| Format | Dimensions | Aspect Ratio |
|---|---|---|
| Stories | 1080 x 1920 px | 9:16 |
| Reels | 1080 x 1920 px | 9:16 |

Stories and Reels share the same full-screen vertical format. Keep important text and elements away from the top and bottom edges, as UI elements (username, buttons) overlay those areas.

### Profile Picture

| Format | Dimensions |
|---|---|
| Profile photo | 320 x 320 px |

Instagram displays profile photos as circles, so make sure key content stays within the center of the square frame.

## LinkedIn Image Sizes

LinkedIn has a more professional context, and image dimensions differ from other platforms.

### Feed Posts

| Format | Dimensions | Aspect Ratio |
|---|---|---|
| Single image post | 1200 x 627 px | 1.91:1 |
| Square post | 1080 x 1080 px | 1:1 |
| Portrait post | 1080 x 1350 px | 4:5 |

**Best practice:** The landscape format (1200 x 627) is LinkedIn's default and works well for link previews and article shares. Square and portrait formats are supported and can stand out in the feed because they take up more vertical space.

### Profile and Banner

| Format | Dimensions |
|---|---|
| Profile photo | 400 x 400 px |
| Banner / cover image | 1584 x 396 px |

LinkedIn banners have an unusual aspect ratio (4:1). Design your banner with important content centered, as the edges may be cropped on mobile devices.

### Company Page

| Format | Dimensions |
|---|---|
| Company logo | 300 x 300 px |
| Company cover | 1128 x 191 px |

## Twitter/X Image Sizes

Twitter (now X) has simplified its image handling over the years, but dimensions still matter for optimal display.

### Feed Posts

| Format | Dimensions | Aspect Ratio |
|---|---|---|
| Single image | 1600 x 900 px | 16:9 |
| Two images | 700 x 800 px each | 7:8 |
| Card image (link preview) | 1200 x 628 px | 1.91:1 |

**Best practice:** The 16:9 ratio (1600 x 900) displays without cropping in the timeline. Vertical images get cropped in the feed, so keep essential content in the center.

### Profile and Header

| Format | Dimensions |
|---|---|
| Profile photo | 400 x 400 px |
| Header image | 1500 x 500 px |

## How to Resize Images with PrivaTools

Now that you know the dimensions, here is how to resize your images quickly and privately.

### Step 1: Open the Resize Tool

Go to [PrivaTools Resize Image](/resize-image). No account or login is required.

### Step 2: Upload Your Image

Drag and drop your image or click to select a file. Your image stays on your device. Nothing is uploaded to any server.

### Step 3: Set the Target Dimensions

Enter the width and height from the tables above. For example, if you are preparing an Instagram portrait post, enter 1080 for width and 1350 for height.

You can lock the aspect ratio to prevent distortion. If your source image does not match the target ratio, consider using the [crop tool](/crop-image) first to adjust the framing before resizing.

### Step 4: Download

Download your resized image. The file is ready to upload directly to your chosen platform.

## Cropping vs Resizing: When to Use Each

**Resizing** changes the dimensions of your entire image. A 3000 x 2000 photo becomes 1080 x 720, with all content preserved but scaled down.

**Cropping** removes parts of the image to change the aspect ratio. A 3000 x 2000 landscape photo can be cropped to a 2000 x 2000 square, cutting off the sides.

In most cases, you will want to combine both operations:

1. First, [crop your image](/crop-image) to match the target aspect ratio (e.g., 4:5 for an Instagram portrait post)
2. Then, [resize the image](/resize-image) to the exact pixel dimensions (e.g., 1080 x 1350)

This two-step approach gives you full control over the framing and ensures nothing important gets cut off unexpectedly.

## Tips for Better Social Media Images

**Always start with high-resolution source files.** Resizing a small image to larger dimensions produces blurry results. Work from the largest version available and scale down.

**Export as JPEG for photos, PNG for graphics.** Photos with gradients and complex colors look best as JPEG files. Graphics with text, logos, and flat colors stay sharper as PNG files.

**Mind the safe zones.** Every platform overlays UI elements (profile icons, like buttons, captions) on certain parts of the image. Keep critical content away from the edges, especially on Stories and Reels.

**Test on mobile.** Most social media consumption happens on mobile devices. Preview your images at mobile screen sizes before posting to catch any cropping or readability issues.

## Why Privacy Matters for Image Editing

Many online image editors and resizers require you to upload your photos to their servers. If you are working with personal photos, client work, branded assets, or unreleased content, that upload creates unnecessary risk.

PrivaTools processes everything locally in your browser. Your images never leave your device. There are no servers, no accounts, and no data collection. Just open the [resize](/resize-image) or [crop](/crop-image) tool, process your image, and download the result. Simple, fast, and private.
