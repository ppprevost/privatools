# 5 Ways to Reduce PDF File Size

A PDF that's too large is a headache. Email servers reject it, upload forms time out, and recipients wait forever to download it. Whether you're dealing with a 50 MB report or a 200 MB presentation deck, there are practical steps you can take to bring that file size down.

Here are five methods that work, ordered from the easiest to the most involved.

## 1. Compress the PDF Directly

The fastest way to reduce a PDF's size is to run it through a compression tool. PDF compression works by optimizing the internal structure of the file, reducing the resolution of embedded images, and stripping unnecessary metadata.

With our [PDF compression tool](/compress-pdf), the process takes seconds:

1. Open the [Compress PDF](/compress-pdf) page.
2. Drop your file into the upload area.
3. Choose your compression level. "Balanced" works well for most documents, reducing size by 40-70% while keeping text sharp and images clear. "Maximum compression" is better when file size matters more than image quality.
4. Download the compressed file.

The entire process runs in your browser. Your PDF never gets uploaded to a server, which matters when you're working with confidential contracts, financial reports, or personal documents.

For most users, this single step solves the problem. A 20 MB PDF with scanned pages typically compresses down to 3-5 MB at balanced settings.

## 2. Split Large PDFs Into Smaller Parts

Sometimes the real issue is that your PDF contains more pages than the recipient needs. A 100-page annual report might only need three specific sections sent by email. Instead of compressing the whole thing, extract just the pages you need.

Our [PDF splitter](/split-pdf) lets you:

- Extract a specific page range (e.g., pages 15-30).
- Split a document into individual pages.
- Create multiple smaller PDFs from a single large one.

This approach also works well when an upload form has a strict file size limit. Split a 30 MB document into two 15 MB halves, upload them separately, and you're done.

## 3. Optimize Images Before Embedding Them

If you're creating a PDF (rather than compressing an existing one), the biggest factor in file size is usually the images inside it. A single uncompressed 4000x3000 photo can add 10-15 MB to your document.

Before inserting images into your PDF:

- **Resize them to the dimensions you actually need.** If an image will display at 800 pixels wide in your document, there's no reason to embed a 4000-pixel original. Use our [image resize tool](/resize-image) to scale images down before inserting them.
- **Compress them first.** Run your images through our [image compressor](/compress-image) at 80-85% quality. The visual difference is negligible, but the file size drops dramatically.
- **Choose the right format.** Use JPG for photos and PNG only when you need transparency. Avoid embedding BMP or TIFF images, as they're uncompressed and massive.

Following these steps before building your PDF can easily cut the final file size by 60-80% compared to using raw, unprocessed images.

## 4. Remove Unnecessary Pages and Elements

PDFs accumulate extra weight from content you might not even realize is there:

- **Blank pages.** Many scanned documents include blank separator pages. Removing them saves space and makes the document cleaner.
- **Duplicate content.** Draft versions sometimes contain repeated sections. A quick review before sharing can identify pages to remove.
- **Embedded fonts.** PDFs often embed the full font files used in the document. If your PDF uses five different fonts, each one adds 100-500 KB. When possible, stick to standard fonts (Arial, Times New Roman, Helvetica) that don't need to be embedded because they're available on virtually every system.
- **Form fields and annotations.** Interactive form fields, comments, and markup layers add to the file size. If you're sharing a final version that doesn't need these features, flattening the PDF removes them and reduces size.

Use the [split tool](/split-pdf) to remove specific pages, then recombine only the ones you need.

## 5. Use Web-Optimized Export Settings

If you're exporting a PDF from software like Microsoft Word, Google Docs, InDesign, or Illustrator, the export settings make a significant difference.

**In Microsoft Word:**
- Go to File > Save As > PDF.
- Select "Minimum size (publishing online)" instead of "Standard."
- This produces a PDF that's often 50% smaller than the standard export.

**In Google Docs:**
- File > Download > PDF Document.
- Google Docs automatically optimizes for reasonable file size, but the results depend on the images in your document. Pre-compressing images before inserting them still makes the biggest impact.

**In Adobe InDesign or Illustrator:**
- Use the "Smallest File Size" preset when exporting.
- Set image compression to JPEG at Medium quality.
- Downsample images to 150 DPI for screen use, or 300 DPI only if the document will be professionally printed.

**In any application:**
- Avoid the "Print quality" or "Press quality" presets unless you're sending files to a commercial printer. These presets preserve maximum resolution and embed color profiles, both of which inflate file size without any benefit for on-screen reading.

## How Much Can You Save?

The results depend on the content of your PDF, but here are typical ranges:

| Method | Typical Size Reduction |
|--------|----------------------|
| PDF compression (balanced) | 40-70% |
| Splitting out needed pages | Varies (proportional) |
| Pre-optimizing images | 60-80% |
| Removing extras | 10-30% |
| Web-optimized export | 30-50% |

Combining multiple methods yields the best results. Optimize your images, export with web settings, and then run the final PDF through a compressor.

## Privacy Matters

Most online PDF tools require you to upload your file to their servers. That means your confidential documents pass through third-party infrastructure. PrivaTools works differently. All processing happens locally in your browser. Your files never leave your device, there are no accounts to create, and there are no limits on how many files you can process.

Try the [PDF compressor](/compress-pdf) or [PDF splitter](/split-pdf) and see the difference for yourself.
