# WebP to JPG: How to Convert WebP Images

You downloaded an image from a website, tried to open it, and got an error. Or maybe you attempted to attach it to an email, only to find out the recipient's software can't display it. Chances are, that image is in WebP format. Here's everything you need to know about WebP, why JPG might be a better choice in some situations, and how to convert between the two.

## What Is WebP?

WebP is an image format developed by Google in 2010. It was designed to make web pages load faster by producing smaller file sizes than traditional formats like JPG and PNG, while maintaining comparable visual quality.

Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari) all support WebP, which is why it has become the default format on many websites. When you right-click and save an image from the web today, there's a good chance it will be a `.webp` file.

## Why You Might Need JPG Instead

Despite WebP's advantages on the web, there are several situations where JPG remains the better choice.

**Email attachments.** Many email clients, especially older versions of Outlook and corporate mail systems, struggle with WebP files. Sending a JPG ensures your recipient can view the image without extra steps.

**Older software.** Photo editors, document processors, and design tools released before 2020 often lack WebP support. If you need to insert an image into a Word document or a PowerPoint presentation, JPG is the safer bet.

**Printing services.** Most print shops and online printing services accept JPG, PNG, or TIFF files. WebP is rarely on their list of supported formats.

**Social media uploads.** While most major platforms now handle WebP, some smaller or older platforms may reject it. JPG is universally accepted.

**Archiving and sharing.** If you're sending photos to family members or storing them for long-term access, JPG is understood by virtually every device and operating system on the planet.

## How to Convert WebP to JPG with PrivaTools

Converting your WebP images to JPG takes just a few seconds with our [WebP to JPG converter](/convert-to-jpg). Here's how.

**Step 1: Open the tool.** Head to the [Convert to JPG](/convert-to-jpg) page on PrivaTools.

**Step 2: Upload your image.** Drag and drop your WebP file into the upload area, or click to browse your files. You can add multiple images at once for batch conversion.

**Step 3: Adjust quality settings.** Use the quality slider to find the right balance between file size and visual clarity. For most purposes, a quality setting between 85 and 92 produces excellent results. If you need the smallest possible file size (for example, for web thumbnails), you can go as low as 70 without noticeable degradation on small images.

**Step 4: Download your JPG.** Click the convert button and download your new JPG file. That's it.

## Understanding Quality Settings

When converting to JPG, the quality setting determines how much compression is applied. Here's a practical guide:

- **95-100:** Near-lossless quality. Large file sizes. Best for professional photography or print.
- **85-92:** The sweet spot for most users. Visually indistinguishable from the original in everyday use.
- **70-84:** Noticeable compression on close inspection, but perfectly fine for web use, social media, or email.
- **Below 70:** Visible artifacts. Only recommended when file size is the top priority.

Keep in mind that every conversion from WebP to JPG involves some recompression. If you start with a heavily compressed WebP file and convert it to a low-quality JPG, the artifacts will stack. When possible, use the highest quality source file available.

## Your Privacy Comes First

One important detail: PrivaTools processes everything directly in your browser. Your images never leave your device. There's no upload to a server, no cloud processing, and no account required. This makes it a solid choice when working with sensitive or personal photos.

## When to Keep WebP

Not every WebP file needs to be converted. If you're building a website or optimizing images for online use, WebP is often the better format because of its smaller file sizes. The conversion to JPG really makes sense when compatibility is your main concern.

If you also need to reduce the file size of your images after conversion, check out our [image compression tool](/compress-image) to squeeze out a few more kilobytes without sacrificing quality.
