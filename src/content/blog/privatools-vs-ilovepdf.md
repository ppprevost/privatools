# PrivaTools vs iLovePDF: Which PDF Tool Is More Private?

When you need to compress, merge, or split a PDF, iLovePDF is often the first result on Google. It is a popular tool with millions of users. But have you ever wondered what happens to your files after you upload them?

In this comparison, we break down how PrivaTools and iLovePDF differ on privacy, performance, limits, and cost.

## How Each Tool Handles Your Files

This is the most important difference between the two services, and it is worth understanding clearly.

**iLovePDF** works by uploading your PDF to their servers. Their backend processes the file, and you download the result. According to their privacy policy, files are stored on their servers for a limited time before deletion. While they state that files are deleted after a few hours, you are still trusting a third party with your documents.

**PrivaTools** takes a fundamentally different approach. Every operation happens directly in your browser using client-side JavaScript. Your PDF never leaves your device. There is no upload, no server processing, and no temporary storage. The file goes from your computer to your browser and back to your computer.

For anyone working with confidential contracts, financial documents, medical records, or legal files, this distinction matters.

## Privacy Comparison

| Feature | PrivaTools | iLovePDF |
|---|---|---|
| File upload to servers | No | Yes |
| Account required | No | Optional (required for premium) |
| Files stored on servers | Never | Temporarily (up to 2 hours) |
| GDPR compliant | Yes (no data collected) | Yes (with data processing) |
| Works offline | Yes (after initial load) | No |

With PrivaTools, privacy is not a policy promise. It is a technical guarantee. Since files never leave your browser, there is nothing to leak, hack, or subpoena.

## Speed and Performance

Because iLovePDF requires uploading and downloading files, speed depends on your internet connection. A 50MB PDF on a slow connection can take minutes just for the transfer, before any processing even begins.

PrivaTools processes everything locally. The speed depends only on your device's hardware. On a modern laptop or desktop, [compressing a PDF](/compress-pdf) typically takes just a few seconds, even for large files. There is no upload wait, no queue, and no server bottleneck.

## File Size Limits

iLovePDF imposes file size limits depending on your plan:

- **Free plan**: up to 100 MB per task
- **Premium plan**: up to 4 GB per task

PrivaTools has **no file size limits**. Since processing happens on your device, the only constraint is your available RAM. Most users can handle files well over 200 MB without issues.

## Feature Comparison

Both tools offer a solid set of PDF operations. Here is how they compare:

| Feature | PrivaTools | iLovePDF |
|---|---|---|
| [Compress PDF](/compress-pdf) | Yes | Yes |
| [Merge PDF](/merge-pdf) | Yes | Yes |
| [Split PDF](/split-pdf) | Yes | Yes |
| PDF to Word | Not yet | Yes |
| OCR | Not yet | Yes (premium) |
| E-sign | No | Yes (premium) |
| Image tools | Yes | Limited |

iLovePDF offers a broader feature set, especially with premium features like OCR and e-signatures. PrivaTools focuses on the most commonly needed operations and delivers them with zero privacy trade-offs.

## Pricing

**iLovePDF** offers a free tier with limitations (watermarks on some outputs, daily task limits for batch processing). Their premium plan starts at $7/month (billed annually) or $9/month billed monthly.

**PrivaTools** is completely free. Every tool, every time, with no limits. There are no premium tiers, no watermarks, and no daily caps. You do not even need to create an account.

## When to Use Each Tool

**Choose PrivaTools if:**
- Privacy is a priority for you
- You work with sensitive or confidential documents
- You want a fast, no-signup experience
- You need unlimited free usage

**Choose iLovePDF if:**
- You need advanced features like OCR or PDF-to-Word conversion
- You prefer a more established brand with a larger feature set
- File privacy is not a major concern for your use case

## The Bottom Line

iLovePDF is a capable tool with a long track record. But its server-based architecture means your files are exposed to third-party infrastructure, even if only temporarily.

PrivaTools eliminates that risk entirely. Your files stay on your device from start to finish. If you regularly [compress PDFs](/compress-pdf), [merge documents](/merge-pdf), or [split large files](/split-pdf), PrivaTools gives you the same core functionality with a level of privacy that server-based tools simply cannot match.

Try it yourself. Open a tool, process a file, and check your network tab. You will see zero outbound file transfers. That is the PrivaTools difference.
